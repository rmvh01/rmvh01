# Roman 'Max' Von Hapsburg

Hello! I'm a normal dude and this is my github!

I recently finished Galvanize's 18-week software engineering immersive program. I left that program
with the knowledge necessary to start filling up this page with projects! I have one project i'll be
devoting a lot of my time to. This app is Gymscribe2 (working title), and i'm looking for contributors on that!

I'm currently trying to improve my skillset by gaining experience with the frameworks i'm working in
now, that's Django, FastAPI and REACT. If you have a project and would like me to help within those
frameworks please react me at my email below!
